                <p>This project taught me a lot. I learnt the design need not be thought from scratch and there might be some problems whose solution is already been found. I also learnt to differentiate and understand what element is necessary and what is not. I learnt to make a website according to the end result. </p>
                <p>I learnt how to showcase a product according to market need. I hope to keep learning and designing much better products than this :).</p>
